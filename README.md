Technical task for Goodwood Front-End Developer

## How to run
To run the platform, open index.html. Note, that due to calls to the wwww.goodwood.com API from a different domain (i.e. localhost), the CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) policy blocks the call for secuity reasons. Note, for local development and to overcome this, in Chrome use the [CORS Unblock]{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en} extension. 

## Task 1:
Create a basic clone of the [Goodwood Road and Racing]{https://goodwood.com/grr} platform using the Goodwood API. 

## Task 2:
